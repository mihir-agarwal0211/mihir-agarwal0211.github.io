I am a Master’s student at **Columbia University** (GPA 4.0/4.0), specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Financial Engineering**. My work bridges the gap between theoretical deep learning and practical, high-stakes engineering systems.

Currently, I am developing **NeuroLOB**, a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates **Neural Point Processes** with **Diffusion Models** to generate high-fidelity Limit Order Book data. This project aims to solve the data scarcity problem in financial microstructure research.

### Industry Experience
Prior to Columbia, I spent 3 years as a **Software Engineer at Shell**, where I focused on **ML-driven Testing Automation**. 
* I engineered a **Test Case Prioritization** system using supervised learning and clustering techniques, which optimized test execution based on historical failure rates and step complexity. 
* This initiative achieved a **35% reduction in execution time**, saving the team significant operational costs annually.
* I also worked on large-scale **Intelligent Automation** pipelines, leveraging RAG and vector retrieval techniques to streamline internal document processing.

Before that, at **Vidrona (London)**, I built computer vision pipelines (YOLO/Faster R-CNN) to automate predictive maintenance for electrical infrastructure using drone imagery.

### Research
My research journey began with a focus on **Fog Computing**. At **LISITE Lab (Paris)**, I co-authored a survey on ML-based resource management, which was published in a **Springer Journal**. I also completed an undergraduate thesis on **Event-Driven Financial Time Series**, proposing early architectures for asynchronous market modeling.

I am actively looking for **Machine Learning Engineer** or **Quant Research** roles where I can apply my expertise in **Generative AI**, **Optimization**, and **System Design**.
